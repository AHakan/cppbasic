## 1- Single Responsibility Principle
A class should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.

## 2- Open Closed Principle
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
but closed for modification.

## 3- Liskov Substitution Principle
The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects 
of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of 
your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.

## 4- Interface Segregation Principle
## 5- Dependency Inversion Principle
