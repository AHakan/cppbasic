## 1- Single Responsibility Principle
The principle defines that a class should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.

## 2- Open Closed Principle
The principle defines that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, 
but closed for modification.

## 3- Liskov Substitution Principle
The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects 
of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of 
your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass.

## 4- Interface Segregation Principle
The principle defines that no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

## 5- Dependency Inversion Principle
The general idea of this principle is as simple as it is important: High-level modules, which provide complex logic, should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules, which provide utility features.
